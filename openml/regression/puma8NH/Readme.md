This is a family of datasets synthetically generated from a realistic
 simulation of the dynamics of a Unimation Puma 560 robot arm. There
 are eight datastets in this family . In this repository we only have
 two of them. They are all variations on the same model; a realistic
 simulation of the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm. The task in these
 datasets is to predict the angular accelaration of one of the robot
 arm's links. The inputs include angular positions, velocities and
 torques of the robot arm. The family has been specifically generated
 for the delve environment and so the individual datasets span the
 corners of a cube whose dimensions represent:
 
 Number of inputs 8. 
 degree of non-linearity (fairly linear or non-linear) 
 amount of noise in the output (moderate or high).
